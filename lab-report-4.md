# **Lab Report 4: Vim**

Hello and welcome to this lab report. In this report I will be talking about vim.
Please ignore my spelling, I am aware that it is not great, but I
cant figure out how to use a spell checker on github.

I will follow these steps and document what I did for each step from 4 - 9. These steps can 
also be found in the Lab Report writeup [here](https://ucsd-cse15l-w24.github.io/week7/index.html).

1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Setup Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
