# **Lab Report 5: Putting it all together**

Welcome to the fifth and final lab report for this class. As per usual, please ignore any misspellings, I 
can't figure out how to enable spell ckeck on here and my spelling is quite bad. For this lab report I will 
be creating a fake debugging scenario and reflecting on the last lab.

## Debugging Scenario

In this scenario I will be making up a fake case of a student question on the website EdStem. I will then
go on to simulate giving feedback to a student and helping them through their issue. In this case I will create
a post regarding the [grading script](https://ucsd-cse15l-w24.github.io/week6/index.html) part of lab 6.
